        <p>I saw Bjork at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told her how
        cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and
        bother her and ask her for photos or anything. She said, “Oh, like
        you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but
        she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand
        shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping,
        and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff
        up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky
        Ways in her hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice
        about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for
        those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her,
        but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When
        she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, she
        stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any
        electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I
        don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them
        in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting her by
        yawning really loudly.
