## Artist Statement
When creating this page, I knew I wanted my portfolio to reflect my background as an artist and designer. To grab the attention of the viewer, I set the hero image of my page to a video of one of my previous creative coding pieces. I also chose an unconventional photo for my biography to further emphasize my personality and stylistic choices.
